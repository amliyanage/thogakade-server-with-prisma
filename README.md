## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To get started with the **Thogakade Server with Prisma** project locally, follow these steps:

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amliyanage/thogakade-server-with-prisma.git
   cd thogakade-server-with-prisma
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have `Node.js` installed. Then, run the following command:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up the database**:
   You will need to configure a PostgreSQL or MySQL database. Once your database is set up, make sure to configure the connection in your `.env` file (explained below).

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following contents:

```bash
DATABASE_URL="your-database-connection-url"
JWT_SECRET="your-secret-key"
```

- `DATABASE_URL`: Connection string to your database (PostgreSQL or MySQL).
- `JWT_SECRET`: A secret key used for signing JWT tokens.

### Prisma Setup

After setting up the database and the environment variables, you need to generate the Prisma client:

1. Run the Prisma migration command to sync your database schema:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

2. Generate the Prisma client:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

### Running the Application

Now you can run the application with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your server should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with it via its API endpoints.
